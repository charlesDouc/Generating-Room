# Generating-Room
#### Milestone 8 - VR Game

So the way I pictured the generation, is having a set of podium that reach a set of models. Podiums are spawn on predefinite position in the room. When a podium is spawned, a model also spawn on the top of it, depending on his type.

I defined 3 types of podiums/models (A,B and C). Those types can be evaluate by their size or the type of object they can have. Only models that are the same types can be spawned on the podium. 

I imagined a button also, that refresh the room (only restart the function that is normally in the **Start ()** of the game manager). I made a simple UML to represent the problem.
